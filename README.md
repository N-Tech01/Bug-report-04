# Bug Report: Security Vulnerability in Canara Bank's Net Banking Platform

## Overview

Hello,

My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while using VirusTotal a reliable online security tool as part of my ethical hacking learning at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in the 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue

While using Canara Bank's net banking platform, I ran a scan using VirusTotal. The scan flagged a potential security threat identified as "CRDF" which I believe could be a new vulnerability affecting the website.

As a concerned user and cybersecurity enthusiast I want to bring this issue to the attention of the security team to ensure that Canara Bank’s platform remains secure for all its customers.

I previously reported an issue involving "SecLoop" and was not acknowledged but it appears this vulnerability has been resolved. Now, I have found a new vulnerability, "CRDF" which I believe could pose a risk to customer data and online security.

I strongly urge the Canara Bank team to investigate this vulnerability promptly and take necessary action to secure the platform.

## Steps

1. Navigate to Canara Bank’s Net Banking platform: [Canara Bank Net Banking](https://canarabank.com/net-banking).
2. Use VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/) to scan the website for any potential threats.
